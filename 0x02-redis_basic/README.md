Certainly! Here's a sample `README.md` file for your Redis basic project:

```markdown
# Redis Basic Project

## Description
This project focuses on implementing basic Redis functionalities in a Python project. The tasks involve writing and reading strings to/from Redis, incrementing values, storing and retrieving lists, and implementing an expiring web cache and tracker.

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- Use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5) for code formatting.
- Include a `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Code should use type annotations.
- Redis should be installed on Ubuntu 18.04 with the specified configurations.

## Setup
To install Redis on Ubuntu 18.04, run the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get -y install redis-server
$ pip3 install redis
$ sed -i "s/bind .*/bind 127.0.0.1/g" /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

Start the Redis server in a container with:

```bash
$ service redis-server start
```

## Tasks

### Task 0: Writing strings to Redis
- Create a `Cache` class with a Redis client.
- Implement a `store` method to write data to Redis.

### Task 1: Reading from Redis and recovering original type
- Implement a `get` method to retrieve data from Redis and recover its original type.
- Implement `get_str` and `get_int` methods.

### Task 2: Incrementing values
- Implement a `count_calls` decorator to count method calls.
- Decorate the `store` method with `count_calls`.

### Task 3: Storing lists
- Implement a `call_history` decorator to store input and output history.
- Decorate the `store` method with `call_history`.

### Task 4: Retrieving lists
- Implement a `replay` function to display the history of calls.

### Task 5: Implementing an expiring web cache and tracker (Advanced)
- Implement a `get_page` function to retrieve HTML content from a URL.
- Track URL access count and cache results with a 10-second expiration.
